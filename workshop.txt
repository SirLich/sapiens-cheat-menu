Sapiens Creative Mode enables you to build creatively in your sapiens world. Here is a list of the current features: 
 - Ability to instantly dig/fill holes
 - Ability to instantly complete and remove buildings
 - Ability to unlock all skills for all sapiens in your tripe
 - Ability to unlock the building UI, even if you haven't seen or discovered the items

Additionally, there is a good cheat UI, build around the lua console. Commands include:
 - cheat:Spawn(...) 
 - cheat:SetSunrise(...)

The CreativeMode mod also adds a "Max Needs" button to Sapiens, to keep them topped up on health and happiness. 

🐛**Known Bugs**

The mod is very early-alpha. Please be patient. 

Essentially, there is some issues with state-management, meaning the UI boxes often show the wrong values, and you need to restart after setting them. 

So make your selection, restart the game, and then re-enable instant-building (if needed). This should allow you to use Creative Mode.
